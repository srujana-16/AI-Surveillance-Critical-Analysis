# Surveillance and AI
This project is part of the **HS7.301 Science, Technology, and Society course at IIIT Hyderabad**.

In this project, we conduct a thorough critical analysis using conceptual frameworks covered in the course on the technology - AI Surveillance. We explore the historical context, actor-network theory, political implications, social constructivism vs. technological determinism, reverse adaptation, incorporation of social biases, megamachines, autonomy concerns, scientific controversies and paradigm shifts regarding the interplay between surveillance technologies and AI. The project aims to provide comprehensive insights into the complex relationship between surveillance technologies, AI, and their impact on society.
